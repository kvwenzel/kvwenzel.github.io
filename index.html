            <h3 class="time">Present</h3>
            <p>I’m a third year HCI PhD student at <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="blank" class=names>Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/geoff-kaufman" target="_blank" class=names>Geoff&nbsp;Kaufman</a> (<a href="https://cmu-eheart-lab.github.io/" target="blank" class=names>eHeart&nbsp;Lab</a>) and <a href="http://www.lauradabbish.com/" target="_blank" class=names>Laura&nbsp;Dabbish</a> (<a href="http://coexlab.com/" target="blank" class=names>CoEx&nbsp;Lab</a>). My work investigates how various stakeholders (users, designers, developers) conceptualize and react to automated bias. I also build positive interventions to address these reactions. My main project focuses on language technology:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Defining & Measuring Harm:</b> What are users’ psychological responses to bias in language technology? How do these responses vary based on individual differences, especially across marginalized identities?</li>
                <li><b>Mitigating & Reversing Harm:</b> How might we design to mitigate or reverse the psychological harm inflicted by bias in language technology?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Other research I’m excited about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How might we evaluate the normative values embedded in various technologies? How might we persuade tech practitioners to design and build more responsibly?</li>
                <li>What are the harms of generative AI, especially for marginalized groups? How might we design to mitigate these harms?</li>
                <li>How have users’ perceptions of surveillance changed Post-Roe? How have users’ privacy and security behavior changed Post-Roe? How do these perceptions and behaviors vary across different gender, reproductive, and national identities?</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Before beginning my PhD, I worked on some <a href="./projects.html">cool projects</a> supporting education equity in STEM.</p>
                <p>I completed my B.A. in computer science at Columbia University, Barnard&nbsp;College.</p>
